      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

<p>In order to test the effectiveness of new products, ‘odor judges’ are hired to smell volunteers’ breath, feet, and armpits. They make sure their judgment is accurate, the members of staff have their sense of smell tested monthly. Let’s hope those products are doing the trick, for the judges’ sake! </p>
<p> Salary estimates for an odor judge range between $19,000 and $52,000, based on the levels of stink.</p>
<p>Companies that have odor judges pertain to personal beauty, urinal cakes, and practical prank fart sprays.</p>
<p>As stated before the level of stank determines the salary of an odor judge. Therefore, the stanky a smell is the higher the salary of the stank smeller. </p>
<p>Minimal Requirements: The minimum qualifications to become an odor tester include <span>a bachelor's degree in chemistry</span>. Some employers prefer applicants with experience in the relevant industry; for example, to be an odor tester for a fragrance company, employers prefer you have previous experience in the beauty industry.</p>
