    <p><span><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" />ODOR JUDGE</span></p>
<p>In order to test the effectiveness of new products, â€˜odor judgesâ€™ are hired to smell volunteersâ€™ breath, feet, and armpits. They make sure their judgment is accurate, the members of staff have their sense of smell tested monthly. Letâ€™s hope those products are doing the trick, for the judgesâ€™ sake!Â </p>
<p>Â Salary estimates for an odor judge range between $19,000 and $52,000, based on the levels of stink.</p>
<p>Companies that have odor judges pertain to personal beauty, urinal cakes, and practical prank fart sprays.</p>
<p>As stated before the level of stank determines the salary of an odor judge. Therefore, the stanky a smell is the higher the salary of the stank smeller.Â </p>
<p>Minimal Requirements:Â The minimum qualifications to become an odor tester includeÂ <span>a bachelor's degree in chemistry</span>. Some employers prefer applicants with experience in the relevant industry; for example, to be an odor tester for a fragrance company, employers prefer you have previous experience in the beauty industry.</p>

<p>Â Notable Facts About Mike</p>
<ul>
<li>Â <span>Small Town Native</span><span>: When I say small, I meanÂ </span><em>small</em><span>.Â  Try 150 people.Â  "I'm from Vance, South Carolina.Â  Everybody knew everybody.Â  It was almost like we were family.Â  I have had a lot of 'cousins' pop up since I've been drafted!"Â  Williams said going to Clemson wasn't necessarily a big difference as the town itself.Â  Although larger than Vance, is still small by most standards.Â  Going to Los Angeles?Â  Williams calls that a "huge difference."Â  "Just the whole city life and traffic, I'm not used to that!Â  I'm used to getting up and going where I need to be, not sitting in traffic.Â  So that's (been) a little different for me."</span></li>
<li><span>Avid Gamer</span><span>: Like many of his Chargers teammates, Williams loves to play video games in his spare time.Â  His favorite? NBA 2K.Â  "It's a game I've played since I was a kid.Â  Hanging out with my friends playing video games was just something I enjoyed outside of playing sports."Â  His new game of choice is Madden.Â  "I also recently just started playing mainly because I'm in the (new) one.Â  I'm trying to get halfway decent!Â  It's weird seeing myself because just playing the game, I've looked up to those guys so knowing I'm in the game, it's crazy."</span></li>
<li>Pregame Mix: Along with praying, Williams listens to music before games.Â  He says he puts his phone on shuffle.Â  "I listen to a lot of different things. I like to listen to Meek Mill, Lil Uzi, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX9msKu75qs">Young Thug and Future</a>."Â  Williams cites <a href="https://twitter.com/reactjpg/status/1262616863185481729">Meek Mill </a>as his favorite artist. Â  Â Â </li>
<li><span><span>Mike Williams also plays and inspired the name of my fantasy team ðŸ˜Ž</span></span></li>
